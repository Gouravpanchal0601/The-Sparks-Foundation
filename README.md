# The-Sparks-Foundation
This repository contains the solution for Task 6 of the Sparks Foundation Data Science Internship. In this task, a Decision Tree Algorithm is used to create a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is to predict the right class for any new data fed to the classifier.

## Dataset

We will use the famous Iris dataset (Iris.csv), which includes three classes of iris plants (setosa, versicolor, and virginica), with 50 samples each. Four features are measured from each sample: the lengths and the widths of the sepals and petals.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
- Decision Tree

## Installation

You can install the required packages using pip
